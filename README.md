## 👋 About Me  

I build AI-powered systems that transform fragmented information and manual workflows into structured, scalable automation solutions.

Rather than simply shipping tools, I focus on architecting intelligent workflows by integrating structured data, retrieval systems, and role-based AI agents to reduce manual work, improve clarity, and drive measurable operational impact. My work sits at the intersection of AI, workflow automation, and real-world business execution.

## 🚀 Selected Projects

### 🏛 Government Funding Interactive Platform  
**Policy Workflow System | Integrated Admin Management Layer**

Designed and built an interactive web platform that transforms complex government subsidy policies into structured, accessible workflows for sales teams and customers.

- Organized large volumes of subsidy information using hierarchical tagging and categorization, enabling users to quickly identify programs that match their eligibility criteria  
- Converted static policy documents into structured decision flows with guided navigation logic  
- Reduced information search friction for non-technical business users through intuitive filtering and conditional routing  
- Implemented a dedicated admin route (/admin/) that allows subsidy program managers to create, edit, or delete program information directly via the web interface — without modifying code or accessing the database  
- Improved operational efficiency by separating user-facing workflows from content management, enabling scalable and maintainable updates

### 🤖 Government Funding AI Agent  
**Vector-Powered RAG System | Conversational AI Assistant**

Built an AI-powered assistant that transforms large volumes of complex government funding documents into a searchable, conversational knowledge system.

- Processed and structured fragmented policy data into a vector store for semantic retrieval  
- Implemented a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflow to enable accurate, context-aware responses  
- Enabled users to interact with the system via natural language to surface detailed policy clauses without manually reading lengthy documents

### ✍️ AI Sales Post Generator  
**Role-Based AI Agent | LLM API Integration | Multi-Platform Publishing Workflow**

Engineered a backend AI agent system that transforms fragmented user bullet points into structured, high-conversion social selling content across Instagram, Threads, and LinkedIn.

- Integrated LLM APIs to power a role-based “Social Media Manager” AI agent that generates complete sales posts from minimal user input  
- Designed prompt orchestration logic to control tone, structure, language (EN/中文), and platform-specific optimization  
- Built a configurable interface allowing users to select publishing platform, writing style, and output language  
- Enabled one-click publishing or copy-to-platform functionality to streamline multi-channel distribution  
- Reduced content drafting and publishing time from manual composition to ~2 minutes, even with minimal input (e.g., a single bullet point)  
- Designed to support modern sales workflows where social selling complements calls, emails, and events for lead nurturing
